# 10-Graphs
Graphs are discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges that connect
these vertices.

## 10.1 Graphs and Graph Models
A graph G=(V, E) consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices(or nodes) and E, set 
of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it,
called its endpoints. An edge is said to connect its endpoints.

A **directed graph (or digraph)** (V , E) consists of a nonempty set of vertices V 
and a set of directed edges (or arcs) E. Each directed edge is associated with
an ordered pair of vertices. The directed edge associated with the ordered pair 
(u, v) is said to start at u and end at v.

The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident 
with it, except that a loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree of that
vertex. The degree of the vertex v is denoted by deg(v).

Handshaking Theorem:
$2m=$
Theorem 2: An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.
+ Are the edges of the graph undirected or directed (or both)?
+ If the graph is undirected, are multiple edges present that connect the same pair of vertices?
If the graph is directed, are multiple directed edges present?
+ Are loops present?

### Bipartite Graphs(er feng tu)
A simple graph G is called bipartite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into
two disjoint sets V 1 and V 2 such that every edge in the graph connects a 
vertex in V 1 and a vertex in V2(so that no edge in G connects either two 
vertices in V 1 or two vertices in V 2 ). When this condition holds, we call the
 pair (V 1 , V 2 ) a bipartition of the vertex set V of G.


Theorem 4:
A simple graph is bipartite if and only if it is possible to assign one of two 
different colors to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices 
are assigned the same color.

HALL’S MARRIAGE THEOREM The bipartite graph G = (V , E) with bipartition
(V 1 , V 2 ) has a complete matching from V 1 to V 2 if and only if |N(A)| ≥ |A| for all subsets
A of V 1 .

A **path** is a sequence of edges that begins at s vertex of a graph and travel 
from vertex to vertex along edges of the graph.
