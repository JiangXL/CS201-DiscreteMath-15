# 10-Graphs
Graphs are discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges that connect
these vertices.

## 10.1 Graphs and Graph Models
A **graph** G=(V, E) consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices(or nodes) and E, set
of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it,
called its endpoints. An edge is said to connect its endpoints.

A **simple graph** is an undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops
are disallowed.

A **directed graph (or digraph)** (V , E) consists of a nonempty set of vertices V
and a set of directed edges (or arcs) E. Each directed edge is associated with
an ordered pair of vertices. The directed edge associated with the ordered pair
(u, v) is said to start at u and end at v.

The **degree** of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident
with it, except that a loop at a vertex contributes _twice_ to the degree of that
vertex. The degree of the vertex v is denoted by **deg(v)**.



## 10.2 Graph Terminology and Special Types of Graphs

Handshaking Theorem:
$$2m=sum(degree)$$

Theorem 2: An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.
+ Are the edges of the graph undirected or directed (or both)?
+ If the graph is undirected, are multiple edges present that connect the same pair of vertices?
If the graph is directed, are multiple directed edges present?
+ Are loops present?

入度: deg-(v); 出度: deg+(v)

Complete Graph(完全图 **$K_n$**)，每对不同顶点之间恰有一条边的简单图。
Cycles(圈图 **$C_n$**),依次用边连接所有的图。
Wheels(轮图, **$W_n$**)，在圈图Cn中增加一个顶点，其与圈图中所有点相连。
n-Cubes(n 立方体图 **$Q_n$**), 用顶点表示 $2^n$ 长度为 n 的位串的图。

邻居: **$N(v)$**

### Bipartite Graphs(二分图)
A simple graph $G$ is called  **bipartite** if its vertex set $V$ can be
partitioned into two disjoint sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that every edge in the
graph connects a vertex in $V_1$ and a vertex in $V_2$(so that no edge inside
$V_1$ or $V_2$. When this condition holds, we call the pair $(V_1 , V_2 )$ a
bipartition of the vertex set $V$ of $G$.

**Theorem 4**:
A simple graph is **bipartite** if and only if it is possible to assign one of
two different colors to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices
are assigned the same color.

**完全二分图**:$K_{m,m}$

**HALL’S MARRIAGE THEOREM**: The bipartite graph $G = (V , E)$ with bipartition
$(V_1 , V_2 )$ has a complete matching from $V_1$ to $V_2$ if and only if
$|N(A)| ≥ |A|$ for all subsets $A$ of $V_1$. (可以看看证明)

## 10.3 Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphing
邻接表，邻接矩阵，关联矩阵

同构的定义：当两个简单图同构时，两个图的顶点之间具有保持相邻关系的一一对应。简单图的同构是等价。

图像不变量。

## 10.4 Connectivity 连通性

A **path** is a sequence of edges that begins at s vertex of a graph and travel
from vertex to vertex along edges of the graph.

若无向图中每一对不同的顶点之间都有通路，则该图称为连通的。

有很多方法可以简单地否定图的同构。
### Paths and Isomorphism

### Counting Paths Between Vertices

割点和割边（桥）

## 10.5 Euler and Hamilton Paths
简单回路

An **Euler cirucui** in a graph is a simple circuit containing every edge of $G$

**定理1** 含有至少2个顶点的连通多重图具有欧拉回路，当且仅当它每个顶点的度都为偶数。
**定理二** 连通多重图具有欧拉通路但无欧拉回路，当且仅当它恰好有两个度为奇数的顶点。

> 如何构建欧拉回路？

经过 G 中每一个顶点恰好一次的简单回路称为 **哈密顿通路**.

**中国邮递员问题：** 图中以最少的边数至少遍历每条边一次。

## 10.6 最短通路

## 10.7 Planar Graphs

欧拉公式： $r=e-v+2$, 其中 r 是平面图的面数。

## 10.8 Graph Coloring
**四色定理:** The chromatic number of a plannar graph is no greater than four.
