# 11. Trees
A connected graph that contains no simple circuits is called a tree. An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple
path between any two of its vertices.

数的遍历：
- 前序遍历
- 中序遍历
- 后序遍历

前缀形式的表达式称为波兰记法，后缀形式的表达式称为逆波兰记法，他们都是无二义。
所以不需要括号。中序遍历得到的表达式需要完整的括号来确保无二义。

### Rooted Trees

A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root and 
every edge is directed away from the root.

A rooted tree is called an m-ary tree if every internal vertex has no more than
m children. The tree is called a full m-ary tree if every internal vertex has
exactly m children. An m-ary tree with m=2 is called a binary tree.

### Properites of Trees:
* A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.

* A full m-ary tree with i internal vertices contain n =mi+1 vertices.

* There are at most m^h leaves in an m-ary tree of heigh h. (shuxu guina)

### Applications of Trees
Binary Search Tress

Decision Trees

A sorting algrithm based on binary conparisons requires at least [log n!]
comparisons.

The average number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm to sort n elements
based on binary comparisons is O(nlogn).
