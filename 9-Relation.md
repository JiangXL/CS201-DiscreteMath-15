# 9-Relations
Relationships between elements of sets are represented using the structure called
a relation.


## 9.1 Relations and Their Properties
A common relation is **binary relation**.
$$ Let A and B be sets. A binary relation from A to B is a subset of A X B.$$

+ *a R b* denote that (a,b) belong to *R*. 
+ *a* is **related to** *b* by *R*.


A function represcents a relation where exactly one element of *B* is related to 
each element of *A*.

The graph of function *f* from *A* to *B* is the set of ordered pairs 
(*a*,*f(a)*) for *a* belong to *A*).

A relation on a set *A* is a relation from *A* to *A*.

### Properties of Relations

A relation *R* on a set *A* called *reflexive* if (a,a) belong to *R* for every 
elements *a* belong *A*.

## 9.4 Closure of Relations


## 9.5 Equivalence Relations

**Definition 1**: A relation on a set *A* is called an equivalence relation if 
it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

**Definition 2**: Two elements *a* and *b* that are related by an equivalence 
relation are called equivalent.(*a*~*b*)
