# Lecture 9.Relations
Relationships between elements of sets are represented using the structure called
a relation.


## 9.1 Relations and Their Properties
A common relation is **binary relation**. Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A binary relation
from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A X B$ 笛卡尔积. $a R b$ denote that $(a,b)$ belong 
to $R$. In other word, $a$ is **related to** $b$ by $R$.

A **function** represcents a relation where exactly one element of $B$ is related t 
each element of $A$. The graph of function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is the set of ordered
pairs $(a,f(a))$ for $a$ belong to $A$. A relation on a set $A$ is a relation from 
$A$ to $A$.

> Qusetion: P 575 Example 4

Here are some properties. Relations $A$ relation $R$ on a set $A$ called **reflexive
（反身的** if $(a,a)$ belong to $R$ for every elements $a$ belong $A$.

## 9.5 Equivalence Relations
Definition 1: A relation on a set *A* is called an **equivalence relation** if 
it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Definition 2: Two elements $a$ and $b$ that are related by an equivalence 
relation are called **equivalent**. We mark it: $(a~b)$

## 9.6 Partial Orderings(偏序)
定义在S上的关系R,如果它是自反的，反对称的和传递的，就称为偏序。集合S和定义在其上的
偏序R一起称为偏序集，记做$(S,R)$。集合S中的成员称为偏序集的元素。
